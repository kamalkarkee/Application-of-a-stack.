Understanding of red-black tree structural constraints.

 Alinear-time C program to test whether a binary tree satisfies the red-black tree properties.
The simple input format corresponds to postorder traversal. An “R” corresponds to a red tree node, a “B” to a black tree
node, and a “.” to the sentinel. If a tree includes n data nodes, then the sentinel will be processed n + 1 times. The input
..B..BB..B..B..R..RBRBB
